## About
**Ecoleta** is an application developed during the NLW01( Next Level Week )at Rocketseat. 

## Motivation
Practice web development in order to reinforce and acquire more knowledge.

- Responsiveness was applied to the pages using media queries. 
- A form to create "recycleable points" within the city. Verb POST was used.
- A page indicating that a recycle point was created successfully, then, after 2s, setTimeout function redirects it to the create-point page.
- If for any reason an error occurred while creating a recycle point, a simple message is displayed to user indicating an error. (To be improved.) 
- A search page shows the results of "recycleable points" that were filtered by "city name" or "recycle point's name".
- A pseudo element was applied on "search results page" to embelish the layout. 

## Future improvements:

- Create a link, then a page to edit a recycle point and include an option to delete.

-  Apply a function "confirm", so user will need to confirm the deletion, otherwise, event.preventDefault()

- Add lottie files animaton to replace the success message, on the "point-created" page. 
- Apply visual message on html, when something goes wrong.
- Apply regular expression to validate whether the url typed for the image is a valid URL.
